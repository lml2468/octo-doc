// Package sluglock provides per-slug write serialization — the in-process
// equivalent of the upstream Cloudflare Durable Object. It makes a slug's
// read-modify-write of its comment list atomic within one process.
//
// The interface admits a future distributed implementation (e.g. a PostgreSQL
// advisory lock) for multi-instance deployments without changing callers.

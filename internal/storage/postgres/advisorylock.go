// advisoryLocker is a sluglock.Locker backed by PostgreSQL advisory locks, so
// per-slug serialization holds ACROSS app instances (the in-process
// sluglock.Memory only serializes within one process). Publishing the same slug
// from two instances can otherwise resolve to the same version and clobber each
// other's blob/meta; the advisory lock closes that window.
//
// Advisory locks are session-scoped: pg_advisory_lock(key) is held by the
// connection until pg_advisory_unlock or the session ends. So each With acquires
// a DEDICATED pooled connection for the lock alone — separate from whatever
// connection fn uses for its own queries — locks, runs fn, then unlocks and
// releases in a defer. The pool must therefore allow at least 2 connections
// (PG_POOL_MAX default 10).
